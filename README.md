# Replayer
Open LoL Replay without using the new client. No session start, just double click and view.

This program just launches the client with the right parameters and execution directory it needs to work.

Plus, it always look up for the last available client, so you won't need to adjust any configuration when the game updates (At least, while they keep their actual file structure).
